**MythicalMinds** is a web-based project created to bring together the richness of **mythology, moral stories, devotional songs, quizzes, and interactive games** into one engaging platform.

The goal is to make learning about epics such as the **Ramayana, Mahabharata, Bhagavatam, and other mythological stories** more fun and interactive by combining text, images, music, quizzes, and games.

This project is not just a collection of pages—it is an attempt to make **our cultural and spiritual heritage more accessible and enjoyable**, especially for younger audiences.

## 📖 Why I Created This Project

With children spending more time on mobile devices, much of the digital content they consume is purely entertainment-driven. This often reduces exposure to **moral values and cultural learning**.

**MythicalMinds** is our effort to:

* Preserve and share mythology and moral education in an engaging format
* Teach **life lessons and values** through interactive stories, songs, and games
* Provide a safe and meaningful **digital alternative** for young audiences

---

## ⚡ Future Plans

* Make the website fully **responsive and mobile-friendly**
* Host videos externally (YouTube, Drive, etc.) instead of storing them in the repo
* Add a **homepage navigation menu** for smoother browsing
* Create a **backend system** to store quiz scores and track progress
* Expand to include **AR/VR immersive storytelling** and **AI personalization**
* Add more **games and puzzles** inspired by mythology
